# Ramanujan’s Door Number Problem Python Implementation 

This repository contains the Python implementation for my Medium article:  

👉 [Ramanujan’s Door Number Problem — From Street Numbers to Continued Fractions](https://medium.com/@shehanpiyumantha310/ramanujans-door-number-problem-from-street-numbers-to-continued-fractions-84cfbd73c040)  

The code explores how Srinivasa Ramanujan solved the famous *House Number Problem* using **continued fractions** and rational approximations to √8.

## Files
